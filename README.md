# Unit3.TestingPuppyPals.StarterCode


As a tester, you are tasked with ensuring that all functions work correctly. You decide to use Jest to test the functionality of the program.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm test` to see the Jest output!

## Instructions

1. Read through `App.jsx` and answer the following warm-up questions:
   1. How do the functions work and data is fetched?
2. Live serve `index.html` to explore the app.
3. Study the example test cases already written for you in `App.test.js`.
4. Write the missing tests! Can you think of any that weren't included?
5. If you have extra time, try to write more robust test cases!
